## Python Sort
This is a simple script for a school assignment to generate a random array of numbers of a specified size.
Sort the numbers and insert them in a relational database. 

For each run, we were required to check the time it would take and record it and aggregate the time in graph.

The size of the array would be changed as required

The code is still in active development.
